This example illustrates how to create a technology stack with the following components:
- Spring Boot 2 with Camel (2.23.x included with Red Hat Fuse 7.4).
- REST DSL in XML form
- Swagger Docs

It provides a simple REST service that is created with Camel REST DSL in XML form and documented with Swagger.

All examples I found documented online were Spring Boot with Java DSL or OSGi/blueprint XML without Spring Boot.

To get to this stage required a bit of rerun and debug, and I thought this would be a good starting point for someone else facing the same issue.
